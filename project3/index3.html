		This piece combines three different texts, all loosely interconnected by the themes of exploration and confinement.</p>
		<p>
		 <em>The House of Asterion</em> by Jorge Luis Borges is a story told from the point of view of the Minotaur, living within the labyrinth and awaiting someone who can 'redeem' him.</p>
		 <p>
		 <em>House of Leaves</em> by Mark Z Danielewski is a book that is in part about a family who discovers that their house is impossibly large inside. The passage included here is of the father's first foray into the dark, hostile interior of the house.</p>
		 <p>
		 <em>In Deep: The Dark and Dangerous World of Extreme Cavers</em> by Burkhard Bilger was an article in <em>The New Yorker</em> about cavers and the challenges faced during explorations deep underground.</p>
		 <p>
		 This project uses hyperlinks to bring passages from each of these texts together. On each page, there will be at least one place that you can click to travel to another page. The narrative formed by combining these texts is meant to be meandering, circling back on itself infinitely, with no set ending. Don't worry about exploring every choice that a page might present at once; you will almost certainly find yourself returning to that page again at some point.
