   <div id="summary"><p>If you’re looking for a full-body workout, rowing might be the choice for you! Rowing machines work your core, legs, arms, and back muscles all at the same time. While rowing machines can seem tricky at first, they’re fairly easy to use. When you’re using the machine, extending your legs to push away from the base is called your “drive” and sliding back to start is called the “recovery.”</p>

   <p>1. Sit down on the seat and bend your knees. Make sure your bottom feels comfortable on the seat and adjust yourself if necessary. Bend your knees so you can get closer to the base of the machine. Look for a flat surface near the bottom of the base where you feet will go, which is called the footplate. Then, find the handle that's attached to the cord on the machine.
    <ul>
    	<li>The handle will be in the center of the base or near the top of the base.</li>
    	<li>Be careful as you sit down because the seat slides.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>2. Secure the footplate strap around the top of your shoelaces. The balls of your feet are the only area that will maintain constant contact with the footplate, since you’ll likely need to lift your heels when your knees are bent. Pull the straps across the top of your foot until your feet feel secure. Make sure your feet don’t slide around on the footplate.
    	<ul>
    		<li>It's best to wear rubber-soled shoes like sneakers, running shoes, or cross trainers while you're using a rowing machine. This makes it less likely your feet will slip.</li>
    		<li>Don’t tighten the strap so tightly that it hurts. If your feet feel uncomfortable, loosen the straps and try again.</li>
    	</ul>  
    </p>

    <p>3. Hold the handle using an overhand grip. The cord on the rowing machine has a handgrip that you’ll pull to work your arms. Grab onto the handle and pull it toward you. Adjust your hands on the handle so that they're in an overhand grip, which means your palms are facing down.
    <ul>
    	<li>Using an underhand grip rotates your arms and increases your risk of injury, so it's best to avoid positioning your hands palms up.</li>
    </ul>
